Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Super J.O.S.H. Bros


Provide a one paragraph description of your project:
Inspired by Super Mario Bros, the Super J.O.S.H. Bros is a platformer game project where the player interacts with a pixelated environment by controlling the movement of a character (moving side to side and jumping) where the aim of the game is to gather the maximum points by destroying monsters and collecting coins.

What is your plan for the first week?
- Create character physics
- Sprite art
- Character movement
- Minor interaction between character and environment

What is your plan for the second week?
- Main menu state system
- Advanced character physics
- Monster movement and monster behavior
- Coin/points collection system
- Simple map making system

What is your plan for the third week?
- Life system
- 8 bit sound system
- Refining monster-character interaction and physics
- Create maps and connection between maps via pipe system
- Animations (level completion, death)

What is your backup plan if things don't work out as planned
Omitting week 3 work, or omitting weeks 2 and 3 work.


Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>


[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1:
	We added and tested the sensors and the main FSM.
	The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead.
	Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the high score feature. We have updated that in the project description as an optional feature.

Repo & Video
