# J.O.S.H. Jump
Inspired by Gravity Guy, J.O.S.H. Jump is a platformer game project where the player interacts with a pixelated environment by flipping the direction of the gravity of the environment (downward/upward). The environment consists of a constantly moving stream of obstacles that they player must maneuver past utilizing the single control provided to them: flip the gravity. The main objective of the game is for the user to avoid obstacles and reach the end of the level as fast as possible, gathering as many points as possible.
