# Super J.O.S.H. Bros
Inspired by Super Mario Bros, Super J.O.S.H Bros is a classic arcade platformer game where the player controls a character and interacts with the pixelated environment by moving side to side and jumping. The environment consists of various obstacles that the player must maneuver through and various monsters that the user must defeat (by for example, jumping on the monster's head). The main objective of the game is for the user to accumulate as many points as possible by defeating monsters and breaking crates (by hitting them with the character's head).
